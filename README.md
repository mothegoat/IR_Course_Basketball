Basketball Information Retrieval
================================
In this project, I extracted and analyzed basketball-related information from the Iranian pro basketball league and the NBA (National Basketball Association). The following tasks are done:
1. Compare NBA teams with regard to the ratio of total wins to overall payment to players in the latest season.
2. Compare the points per game of Iranian teams to the NBA teams
3. Analyze the most frequent word used in the basketball section of the most famous sport news website of Iran, [Varzesh3](https://varzesh3.com)

The project can be seen in [this notebook](<HW2.ipynb>) (in Persian)
